### About me
Hi my name is Matt.  Can you and I be friends?

##### Work Info
I'm an interaction designer.  I worked for almost six years at the ACTIVE Network and now am looking for something new.  Hire me!

##### Extracurricular
Outside of work, I like to be as active as possible.  In a normal week, I've probably played ultimate frisbee, hockey, kickball and done a lot of flying trapeze.  I've also run some 20 half and 20 full marathons.  It's fun, if a bit physically demanding.
